hdnet |version| manual
======================

`hdnet` stands for Hopfield denoising network. It is a Python package
for analysis of neural population spiking data, i.e. parallel spike trains.

In particular, it provides a novel method for finding and extracting
salient low-dimensional representations of the dynamics of populations
of spiking neurons based on a denoising approach to spatiotemporal
patterns (STP) contained in the data.

An always up-to-date online-version of the documentation can be obtained
